# Best Eats

A food shop project built with React, Tailwind CSS, JSON Server, and Axios.

# Description

Best Eats is a food shop project built with React that allows users to browse through different food items, add them to their cart, and place orders. The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and JSON Server to simulate a backend server for storing food items and user information. Axios is used to fetch data from the server and handle HTTP requests.

# Installation

2. Install dependencies by running npm install.
3. Start the JSON Server by running npm run server.
4. Start the React app by running npm start.

# Usage
